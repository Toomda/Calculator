Just a fun Project I did in 1-2 Hours. First time doing some web-development without a framework or library. Just pure HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. 
Was really fun, and I think there is so much more that I could do better, in a more efficient and saver way. 
But it works for my first project without librarys and frameworks :) 

Trying to find someone for review :)
